    "Faced with long customer wait times due to manual car evaluations, **Cars 4 You needed a faster and automated way to estimate used car prices.** Our goal was to build a predictive model that estimates car prices from user-inputted features, reducing wait times and providing clear, data-driven explanations to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We started by cleaning and preparing a large dataset of over 75 000 past car listings.** This involved fixing errors like negative mileage, standardizing misspelled brand names, and creating new, insightful features like the car´s age and average yearly mileage. To ensure our model would perform reliably on new data, we **built a training pipeline that avoids data leakage**, a common pitfall where information from the future influences the model´s training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then **tested several different machine learning algorithms**. While simpler linear models provided a decent baseline, a **Random Forest model** proved to be the winner. It achieved an **exceptional accuracy score** (R^2 of 0.97), meaning it explains nearly all the variation in the car prices, and its average prediction error was under $1000. It also showed no signs of overfitting, performing just as well on new data as it did on the data it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model was used to generate price predictions and to help us understand why a car is valued a certain way. The most influential factors were the **car´s engine size, age and fuel efficiency (mpg).** In fact, just eight key features were responsible for 90% of the model decision making, which highlights where customers and the company should focus their attention. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, **this automated pricing system can speed up Cars 4 You initial evaluation process and also provides transparent, insight-driven price justifications** which enhances customer trust and supports strategic decision-making\n"

    "### 1.1 Overview and Main Goals\n",
    "Cars 4 You is currently facing significant operational challenges due to a sharp increase in requests for used car evaluations. The current process, reliant on physical inspections by mechanics, creates long waiting times and drives many potential customers to competitors.\n",
    "The main goal is to expedite the evaluation process by creating a predictive model capable of evaluating the price of a car based on the user’s input without needing the car to be taken to a mechanic.\n",
    "Beyond prediction, the project also aims to analyze which variables most significantly influence price, enabling the company to provide clear, motivated explanations to customers and increase trust in the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Process and Model Assessment Strategy\n",
    "To ensure the model is reliable and generalizable to unseen data, we adopted a robust **5-Fold Cross-Validation** strategy combined with a **Randomized Search** for hyperparameter optimization.\n",
    "The procedure follows these critical steps:\n",
    "*   **Iterative Cross-Validation:** The dataset is split into training and validation sets 5 times (5 folds).\n",
    "*   **Data Leakage Prevention:** All preprocessing steps are performed strictly *within* each fold (fitted only on the partial training set and applied to the validation set) to prevent future information from \"leaking\" into the model.\n",
    "*   **Feature Selection (RFE):** We utilize Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most relevant feature sets and discard noise.\n",
    "*   **Optimization:** A **Randomized Search** explores various hyperparameter combinations to maximize final model performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 2.2.1 General View\n",
    "**1. Missing Data Patterns:**\n",
    "   - `tax` and `mpg` show significant incompleteness with only approximately 68,000 valid records out of 75,973\n",
    "   - `hasDamage` has minimal variance (all values are 0.0), indicating that this feature has no discriminative power for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Anomalies and Outliers:**\n",
    "   - `mileage`: The negative minimum value (*-58,540.57*) indicates data entry errors that require correction through outlier capping.\n",
    "   - `tax`: Negative values (*-91.12*) are logically inconsistent and require preprocessing.\n",
    "   - `mpg`: Negative values (*-43.42*) are physically impossible and must be treated as anomalies.\n",
    "   - `engineSize`: Small negative value (*-0.10*) represents an additional data anomaly that requires appropriate preprocessing.\n",
    "   - `year` and `previousOwners`: Both variables are stored as float despite representing discrete count data and require type conversion to integer, `previousOwners` additionally exhibits logically invalid negative minimum value (*-2.35*) thus adequate preprocessing is required (outlier capping).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Distributional Characteristics:**\n",
    "   - `year`: Heavily concentrated in *2016-2019* (IQR = 3 years), with a mean of *2017*\n",
    "   - `mileage`: Right-skewed distribution (positive skewness) with large dispersion (std = *22129.79*)\n",
    "   - `tax`: Concentrated around *145* (median and 75th percentile), with low variability except for outliers reaching 580, highlighting the need for robust outlier treatment.\n",
    "   - `mpg`: Relatively symmetric distribution around *54.3* (median), with reasonable dispersion (std = *16.50*)\n",
    "   - `engineSize`: Concentrated between *1.2 and 2.0* (IQR), typical for vehicles, with some high-performance outliers up to *6.6*\n",
    "   - `previousOwners`: Discrete distribution concentrated around *1-3* previous owners (IQR), with a mean of *2*\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Identified Preprocessing Requirements:**\n",
    "   - **Outlier Treatment:** Multiple features require IQR-based capping to handle impossible values (`mileage`, `tax`, `mpg`, `engineSize`).\n",
    "   - **Missing Value Imputation:** Develop strategies for missing values in key features (`tax`, `mpg`, `mileage`).\n",
    "   - **Data Type Conversion:** Convert from float to integer type to ensure proper data representation (`year`, `previousOwners`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Summary*:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset exhibits typical characteristics of real-world automotive data with significant quality issues that require systematic preprocessing. The identified anomalies (negative values, out-of-range percentages, incorrect dtypes) must be addressed through robust outlier capping, type conversion, and imputation strategies before model training. The high rate of missing data in `tax` and `mpg`, suggests that feature engineering will be necessary to maximize model performance."

    "#### 2.2.2 Visualization of Outliers through Box Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The box plots of numeric variables reveal the distribution and presence of outliers in each feature, clearly highlighting the need for treatment through capping with the IQR method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Analysis by Feature:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. `mileage`**\n",
    "- **Distribution:** Heavily skewed with numerous outliers on the right, indicating wide variability in vehicle `mileage`.\n",
    "- **Evident Outliers:** Extremely high values well separated from the main body of the distribution.\n",
    "- **Implication:** Requires IQR capping to normalize the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `tax`**\n",
    "- **Distribution:** Concentrated in the main body with some isolated outliers on the right.\n",
    "- **Identified Outliers:** Anomalous values well distant from the main mass, indicating exceptionally high taxes.\n",
    "- **Implication:** Capping is necessary to reduce the impact of these anomalous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `mpg` (Miles per Gallon)**\n",
    "- **Distribution:** Moderately concentrated around the median with outliers on the right.\n",
    "- **Moderate Outliers:** Physically implausible values indicating measurement or data entry errors.\n",
    "- **Implication:** Evident outliers require correction through capping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. `engineSize`**\n",
    "- **Distribution:** Concentrated and symmetric in the main body with some outliers on the right.\n",
    "- **Present Outliers:** Extreme values representing high-performance engines, but minority.\n",
    "- **Implication:** Capping protects against anomalous vehicles without losing relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. `previousOwners`**\n",
    "- **Distribution:** Concentrated and discrete with some outliers on the right.\n",
    "- **Rare Outliers:** Extreme values infrequently occurring but present.\n",
    "- **Implication:** Capping brings these values back within the plausible range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Conclusion:*\n",
    "\n",
    "All box plots clearly confirm the necessity of **IQR capping** to treat outliers in all numeric variables. This preprocessing step is essential because outliers can distort model training by inflating feature variance and leading to poor predictions. Capping outliers ensures the model learns from representative data and improves prediction accuracy.\n"

    "#### 2.2.3 Categorical Data Inconsistencies and Mapping Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis reveals critical data quality issues in categorical features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. `brand`**\n",
    "- **Identified Anomalies:** Multiple variations of the same brand due to case inconsistencies (uppercase, lowercase, mixed case) and truncated/erroneous entries (e.g., 'Mercede' instead of 'Mercedes', 'For' instead of 'Ford', 'V' or 'W' or 'vw' instead of 'VW').\n",
    "- **Impact:** Creates artificial fragmentation with dozens of unique values instead of the expected ~10 major automotive brands.\n",
    "- **Resolution:** `brand` standardization mapping will consolidate all variations into canonical brand names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `transmission`**\n",
    "- **Identified Anomalies:** Significant variation in how transmission types are recorded, including case variations (Manual, manual, MANUAL), truncated entries (Manua, anual, nual), and spelling errors (automatI, utomatic, emi-auto).\n",
    "- **Impact:** Fragmentation of transmission types into dozens of unique values when there should be only 4 categories (Manual, Semi-Auto, Automatic, Unknown).\n",
    "- **Resolution:** `transmission` mapping will consolidate all variations into four standard categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `fuelType`**\n",
    "- **Identified Anomalies:** Case inconsistencies (Petrol, petrol, PETROL), truncated entries (Petro, etrol, ETROL for Petrol; Diese, iese, iesel for Diesel; Hybri, ybrid for Hybrid), and erroneous entries (Other, ther).\n",
    "- **Impact:** Creates unnecessary fragmentation with dozens of unique values instead of the 5 standard fuel types (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric, Unknown).\n",
    "- **Resolution:** `fuelType` mapping will standardize all entries into five canonical categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. `model`**\n",
    "- The `model` variable was excluded from the analysis due to excessive cardinality (735 unique values) and the inability to validate and standardize all vehicle model entries reliably. Consequently, we focused our analysis on the more manageable and standardizable categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Preprocessing Action:*\n",
    "\n",
    "All identified anomalies will be corrected using mapping dictionaries that will consolidate all variations of each category into standard values.\n",
    "This systematic approach ensures data consistency and prevents model degradation caused by artificial feature fragmentation."

    "### 2.3 Feature Correlation with *Target Variable* Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation matrix visualizes the linear relationships between all numeric variables in the dataset, with particular attention to the correlation with the target variable `price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Heatmap Interpretation:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive Correlations with `price` (Target):**\n",
    "  - `engineSize` (0.61): Moderate-positive correlation. Vehicles with larger engines tend to have higher prices. This is the numeric feature with the strongest correlation with price, suggesting high importance in the predictive model.\n",
    "  - `tax` (0.30): Weak-positive correlation. Road tax is slightly correlated with price; more expensive cars tend to have higher taxes.\n",
    "  - `mpg` (-0.29): Weak-negative correlation. Counterintuitively, higher fuel consumption (higher mpg) is associated with slightly lower prices, suggesting that more fuel-efficient cars are more economical.<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Negative Correlations with `price`:**\n",
    "  - `mileage` (-0.41): Moderate-negative correlation. It is the second strongest correlation (in absolute value). Cars with higher mileage have significantly lower prices, as expected in the used car market.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Correlated with `price`:**\n",
    "  - `previousOwners` (−0.00): Practically zero correlation. The number of previous owners has no linear relationship with price in the dataset. This feature may have limited utility in the predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Implications:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevant Features:** `engineSize` and `mileage` are the numeric features with the strongest correlations with `price` and should have high importance in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multicollinearity:** There is no extreme multicollinearity among features (no correlation > 0.7 between different features), which favors the stability of the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection:** `previousOwners` shows zero correlation with `price` and could be considered for exclusion or as a candidate for elimination during the feature selection process via RFE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Interdependence:** The moderate correlation between `tax` and `mpg`, as well as between `engineSize` and `mpg`, suggests potential redundant information; however, they remain distinct features with complementary information useful for prediction."

    "### 2.4 Preprocessing Function Defining\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure reproducibility and streamline the machine learning pipeline, a dedicated `preprocessing_train_val` function has been developed to automate all preprocessing steps. This function will be integrated into the cross-validation framework to maintain consistency across all training and validation folds, this function performs essential data preprocessing steps for machine learning, specifically for the training and validation sets. The procedure includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outlier Capping**: uses the IQR method to cap extreme values in numeric features, reducing the impact of outliers on the model using the following formula: Q1/Q3 ± 1.5 * IQR.\n",
    "- **Missing Value Imputation and dtypes conversion**: convert dtypes where needed (`year` and `previousOwners`) and replaces missing values in numeric features with the median from the training set, and in categorical features with a placeholder (\"Unknown\").\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: creates new variables such as `usage_year` (years since the car was produced) and `avg_miles` (average miles per year), improving the model's predictive power.\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding**: transforms categorical variables into binary columns, making them compatible with ML algorithms; this step is essential for including categorical features in ML models.\n",
    "- **Min-Max Scaling**: normalizes numeric features between 0 and 1, facilitating algorithm convergence and reducing the impact of scale differences between features. Min-Max scaling is used to avoid forcing variables into a normal distribution, which is an assumption not required in this project.\n",
    "- **Features Check**: this step validates and selects only the relevant features for modeling, ensuring that only those contributing to model performance are retained in the preprocessed datasets, while excluding:\n",
    "  - `paintQuality%`: cannot be used as it requires manual mechanic assessment, not user input\n",
    "  - `hasDamage`: no discriminative power with all values equal to 0\n",
    "  - `model`: excessive cardinality preventing reliable standardization\n",
    "  - `carID`: identifier with no predictive value\n",
    "  - `year`: used only for feature engineering and not needed in the final feature set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for modeling, minimizing bias and improving prediction accuracy."

    "### 3.1 Feature Selection Strategy\n",
    "Feature selection was implemented through the dedicated function `find_best_features_train_val` to ensure reproducibility and streamline the machine learning pipeline , which automatically identifies the optimal feature subset using an hybrid approach starting from Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1 *Why this approach?*\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was selected as the foundational step for our feature selection strategy because of three distinct advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligent Ranking:** RFE evaluates which features actually matter for predictions, rather than just looking at correlations. This automatically handles feature interactions without extra work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear importance ordering:** RFE provides a definitive ranking of all features from most to least important, this ordered list is crucial for our selection phase, allowing us to test feature subsets systematically (e.g., top 1, top 2, top 3...) rather than testing random combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applies to any model:** We use Ridge to run RFE because it's fast, reliable and handles multicollinearity well, but the selected features work equally well in any model we test whether it's Linear Regression, RandomForest, or neural networks, furthermore for that reason Ridge makes easy iterate the process within a typical machine learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We opted for this hybrid approach to avoid recalculating RFE every iteration but instead use it as the foundational ranking for our feature selection strategy, saving significant computational time since this procedure will subsequently be embedded also within a cross-validation pipeline.\n",
    "#### 3.1.2 *Defining of the Function:*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells below defines the functions `adjusted_r2` (for the computation of the adjusted R²) and `find_best_features_train_val`, which evaluates the model on different feature subsets, computing both R² and adjusted R² on the training and validation sets. The selection criterion is the adjusted R² on the validation set, to avoid artificially increasing performance by adding more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works in two simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Ranking:** First, it trains the model on all data to see which variables are the most important and then creates a ranked list from the most useful to the least useful feature.\n",
    "2.  **Testing & Selection:**\n",
    "    *   It tests the model multiple times: first using only the best feature, then the top two, then the top three, and so on...\n",
    "    *   For each test, it retrains the model and checks how well it works on both training and validation data.\n",
    "    *   It calculates the **Adjusted R²**, a score that rewards accuracy but penalizes the model if we add useless variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Choice:** The function compares the results of all these tests and picks the specific group of features that gave the highest Adjusted R² score on the validation data. This ensures we select only the features that actually help the prediction, filtering out \"noise\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns the best list of features found and the performance history for every step of the test."

    "### 3.2 Model Assessment Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `avg_score_reg_train_val` evaluates a regression model using 5-fold cross-validation, it was developed using the various previously defined functions, which were specifically designed to fit into this model assessment function within a cross-validation framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.1 *Why Cross Validation?*\n",
    "This method allows the utilization of the entire dataset for both training and testing across different iterations, offering a significant advantage over the holdout method by maximizing data usage rather than reducing the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "By expanding the variety of data splits, it provides a more robust and less biased estimate of model performance compared to a single train-test split, reducing variance and bias by ensuring every observation is used for both training and validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it helps prevent overfitting by evaluating performance across diverse data subsets and allows for reliable comparison of different models and hyperparameter configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only tangible drawback is the increased computational cost that worth all these advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.2 *Defining of the Function:*\n",
    "For models requiring hyperparameter tuning (`Ridge()`, `Lasso()`, `RandomForestRegressor()`, `MLPRegressor()`), you can pass a `param_dist` dictionary to perform RandomizedSearchCV, for simple models (like `LinearRegressor()`), leave `param_dist=None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function performs the following steps:\n",
    "1.  **Splitting:** Stratified train/validation splits.\n",
    "2.  **Preprocessing:** Outlier capping, imputation, feature engineering, encoding, and scaling.\n",
    "3.  **Feature Selection:** RFE based on adjusted R².\n",
    "4.  **Training & Evaluation:** Model fitting with optional hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns aggregated cross-validation results: average execution time, mean R² scores, MAE, and RMSE for both training and validation sets (each with standard deviation), plus the list of optimal hyperparameters identified in each fold. This comprehensive evaluation framework ensures robust model assessment while maintaining data integrity throughout the cross-validation process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.3 *Performance Metrics Used*\n",
    "The following metrics were selected to evaluate the model's accuracy and reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):** Represents the percentage of the data's variation that the model can explain, it tells us generally how well the model fits the data (a score closer to 1 is better).\n",
    "*   **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** The average error between the predicted price and the actual price, it gives a clear idea of the average mistake the model makes in dollars. It is easy to interpret.\n",
    "*   **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Similar to MAE, but it squares the errors before averaging them, it gives more weight to large errors. We use it to see if the model is making any huge mistakes on specific cars, even if the average error is low."

    "#### 3.3.4 Testing `MLPRegressor()` with Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell performs hyperparameter tuning and evaluation of an **MLPRegressor** (Multi-Layer Perceptron) using the `avg_score_reg_train_val` function, with 5-fold cross-validation. Cross-validation enables a robust estimation of the model's performance, avoiding bias from a specific data split and providing a more reliable assessment of generalization ability.  \n",
    "The following hyperparameters are optimized:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **hidden_layer_sizes**: defines the network architecture, i.e., the number of neurons in each hidden layer. For example, `(50,)` indicates a single hidden layer with 50 neurons, while `(50, 50)` or `(100, 50)` indicate networks with two hidden layers.\n",
    "- **alpha**: L2 regularization parameter that controls the strength of weight penalization; higher values reduce overfitting but may oversimplify the model.\n",
    "- **max_iter**: maximum number of iterations (epochs) for training; higher values allow better convergence, especially for deeper networks or complex datasets.\n",
    "- **solver**: optimizer used to update weights; here set to `'adam'`, an adaptive stochastic gradient descent method suitable for medium-to-large problems.\n",
    "- **learning_rate_init**: initial learning rate, controlling the step size for weight updates during training.\n",
    "- **activation**: activation function for hidden layers; `'relu'` (fast and effective for many deep networks) and `'tanh'` (zero-centered sigmoid function) are tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure allows exploring different MLP architectures and configurations, identifying the one best suited to the dataset in terms of performance and generalization, thanks to the robustness of cross-validation."

    "All models except `Lasso()` retained all 23 features across all folds. Lasso consistently removed `fuelType_Electric` in four folds and an additional feature (`Brand_Unknown`) in another fold. This occurred because unlike the other models, it used a Lasso estimator instead of Ridge during the RFE, which promotes stronger feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Final Model Selection* \n",
    "RandomForest was selected as the final model based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance:** R² = 0.969 vastly exceeds competitors.\n",
    "- **Stability:** Identical hyperparameters across all folds demonstrate robustness.\n",
    "- **Generalization:** Zero train-validation gap confirms the model captures genuine patterns.\n",
    "- **Computational balance:** 25.9s per fold is acceptable for training while being a lot faster than MLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dramatic performance gap (R² = 0.969 vs 0.741-0.802) suggests car prices are driven by complex, non-linear interactions between features that linear models cannot capture—precisely the strength of tree-based ensemble methods."

    "This section concludes the analysis conducted throughout the notebook by identifying the most important variables for the predictive model. In line with the business needs defined at the beginning, we analyze which features have the greatest impact on price formation.\n",
    "#### *Methodology*\n",
    "The analysis develops in two phases:\n",
    "1. *Feature Importance*: We calculate how much each variable contributes to the predictions of the final model\n",
    "2. *Cumulative Importance*: We identify the minimum number of features needed to explain 90% of the variability\n",
    "#### *Practical Results*\n",
    "The results show which variables are actually decisive for the price. This information allows us to:\n",
    "- Identify the key factors that influence the price\n",
    "- Support future decisions based on data\n",
    "- Clearly communicate which variables have greater value\n",
    "#### *Transferability*\n",
    "The analysis provides insights directly applicable to future predictions and classifications, translating technical results into concrete and informed decisions."

    "### 5.2 Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Interpretation of Feature Importance (Random Forest Regressor)*\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we are dealing with a *regression* problem, so the \"Importance Score\" shown on the X‑axis of the plot represents the *Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI), so the **average reduction in variance* that each feature produces within the Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time one of the trees in the forest performs a split using a given variable (for example engineSize), it computes *how much that split reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE)* in the \"child\" nodes compared with the \"parent\" node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, *the longer the bar in the plot, the more that variable has been crucial in reducing the variance of the price prediction error*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, the features with the longest bars (such as engineSize, usage_year, and mpg) are therefore the main *drivers of price*: they are the variables the Random Forest relies on the most to distinguish between cheaper cars and higher‑value cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the cumulative importance curve, we see that to explain about *90% of the total variability* of the model it is sufficient to consider *the first 8 features. This means that, if the computational cost of the final model becomes too high for the company, *Cars 4 You could *reduce the dimensionality of its dataset* and of the pipeline by keeping only these main features, while still retaining almost all of the predictive power of the full model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Detailed Interpretation of Top Features*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Top 5 Most Important Features:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *engineSize (22.65%)* - Engine displacement is the most critical factor. \n",
    "   Small engines → economical cars (low prices), large engines → sports cars (high prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *usage_year (15.26%)* - Car age is crucial. New cars retain value, \n",
    "   old cars lose value. The feature engineering (usage_year) works very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *mpg (14.70%)* - Fuel efficiency helps identify engine power. \n",
    "   Low MPG = powerful engine = high price.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *transmission_Manual (11.15%)* - Transmission type influences price. \n",
    "   Manual transmission < automatic transmission in market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *mileage (9.24%)* - Total mileage matters, but less than age \n",
