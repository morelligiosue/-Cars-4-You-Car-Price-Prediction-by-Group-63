# Cars 4 You – Used Car Price Prediction (Group 63)

This repository contains the group project for the Machine Learning course 2024/2025. The goal is to build a regression model that predicts used car prices for Cars 4 You using tabular data.

## Repository structure

- `Group_63_notebook.ipynb` – main notebook with the full pipeline (EDA, preprocessing, model benchmarking, optimization, open-ended analysis, deployment).  
- `data/train.csv` – training data provided for the project.  
- `data/test.csv` – test data used to generate submission predictions.  
- `data/sample_submission.csv` – example submission file.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Create a Python environment with the usual data science stack (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).  
3. Place `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `sample_submission.csv` inside the `data/` folder if not already present.  
4. Open `Group_63_notebook.ipynb` and run all cells from top to bottom.  
5. The final section of the notebook generates the `.csv` file with predictions for Kaggle.
